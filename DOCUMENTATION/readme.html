            <p>Extension page: <a href="http://www.rocketweb.com/kick-butt-search">http://www.rocketweb.com/kick-butt-search</a></p>
            <p>Magento's default search is far from optimal. The Kick Butt Search extension will improve your store's search results by both
            making the search more relevant and giving you a set of handy methods to directly change the search results</p>

            <h2 id="features">Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Increase the relevance of keyword matches in titles and/or SKUS for a better ordering of your search results</li>
                <li>Allows searching through cms pages, blog posts (created with the AheadWorks Blog module) and categories</li>
                <li>Allows defining a set of search terms and their exact search results. You can also define a single
                    entity for a search term which will take the users directly to the entities' detail page instead of passing
                    through the results page</li>
                <li>Allows increasing search weight for specific products so they appear higher in the results</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

            <h3>Backup your data</h3>
            <p>Backup the database and your store's web directory.</p>

            <h3>Disable Compilation</h3>
            <p>This step is for Magento 1.4+ versions. If you are running an older version, this step can be skipped. In the Magento admin panel, go to System->Tools->Compilation.
            In case "Compiler Status" is "Enabled", click on the "Disable" button (in case the status is disabled you can skip this step): </p>
            <p><img src="skin/img/disablec1.png" /></p>

            <p>This screen should now look like this:</p>
            <p><img src="skin/img/disablec2.png" /></p>

            <h3>Download and Extract</h3>
            <p>Download and extract (unzip) the extension's contents on you computer. Navigate inside the extracted folder.</p>

            <h3>Upload files</h3>
            <p>Using a FTP client, upload the content of the extension directory to the store's document root, so that the app directory in
            the extension folder overwrites the app directory on the server. If asked to replace any files, select "Yes".</p>

            <h3>Clear the cache</h3>
            <p>In the Magento admin panel, go to System->Cache Management and press the "Flush Magento Cache" button:</p>
            <p><img src="skin/img/cc.png" /></p>

            <h3 id="reindex-catalog-search">Re-index catalog search index</h3>
            <p>A message that the catalog search index is not up to date will appear. Click on the link:</p>

            <p><img src="skin/img/i1.png" /></p>

            <p>Select the "Catalog Search Index" and press the submit action, making sure the selected action is "Reindex Data"
                (depending on the number of products, this may take a while):</p>

            <p><img src="skin/img/i2.png" /></p>

            <h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
            
            	<h3 id="field_meaning">The meaning of title, sku and content fields for the searcheable entities</h3>
                <p>Kick Butt Search will split the searchable fields into "title", "sku" and "content". The "content" ones will always have the weight of one,
                while title and sku can be configured (they have the weights 5 and 3 by default). The whole point of weights is to give more importance to certain fields
                like product title or blog keywords, improving the quality of the search results. The following table describes what entity attributes does each field contain:</p>
                <table class="table" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
                    <tr>
                        <th>Entity</th>
                        <th>Title field</th>
                        <th>Sku Field</th>
                        <th>Content field</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Product</strong></td>
                        <td>Product name</td>
                        <td>Product SKU</td>
                        <td>All product attributes defined as searchable</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Category</strong></td>
                        <td>Category name</td>
                        <td>n/a</td>
                        <td>Category description</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>CMS Page</strong></td>
                        <td>CMS page title, Content heading</td>
                        <td>n/a</td>
                        <td>CMS page content</td>
                    </tr>

                        <td>Blog post title, keywords</td>
                        <td>n/a</td>
                        <td>Blog post content</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>

                <h3 id="relevance">Increasing relevance for title and sku</h3>

                    <p>(This feature is on by default, follow these steps if you want to change/tweak it)</p>
                    <p>In the Magento admin panel, go to System->Configuration, then click on the "Kick Butt Search" link from the
                    right menu, located under "ROCKETWEB EXTENSIONS". You will see the following screen:</p>

                    <p><img src="skin/img/c1.png" /></p>

                    <p>From here, you can enable and disable this feature. Note that you will need to re-index the Catalog Search Index
                    after a enable/disable operation.</p>
                    <p>The next option is to Enable the search of skus in the products that are associated or compose a configurable, bundle  or 
                    grouped product.</p>
                    <p>The third option is to escape "-" or "+" characters when the search is done in Combined mode. If this option is disabled 
                    MySQL match against will split the words and give more results that might not be relevant.</p>
                    <p>You can also change the weight of the title or sku from here. A weight of 5 for the title means that a keyword match in
                    the title will be 5 times more important than a match in the description/other fields. A weight of 0 makes the title
                    match be as important as any other match (default behaviour). Note that this only changes the order of you search results,
                    not the number of found items.</p>

                    <p>Back on the frontend, a search for a term will bring the title matches first, which is something that you want
                    in most cases:</p>

                    <p><img src="skin/img/c2.png" /></p>
                    


                <h3 id="weight">Increase the search weight for a specific product</h3>

                    <p>This feature is usefull if you have products that you want to show higher in the search results</p>
                    <p>In the Magento admin panel, go and edit the product you want to assign a higher weight:</p>

                    <p><img src="skin/img/c5.png" /></p>

                    <p>The Search Boost attribute is a numeric value that defines how important a product is in search results.
                    A value of empty, zero or one means that the product does not have any special weight.</p>
                    <p>The weight must be considered in context: If product X has the boost attribute set to two and you do a search
                    that does not matches X's title, other products that have title matches will appear first (as the title match is 5x),
                    but X will appear as the first of the products that do not have a title match. If you would set the boost to 10,
                    then X will appear in front of the products that have title matches too. Setting proper boosts requires some
                    experimentation with the search results, as boosts that are too big may bring irrelevant results in the top of the
                    searches. </p>
                    
               <h3 id="cms">Searching through CMS pages</h3>

               		<ul>
               			<li><strong>CMS Results block title</strong> - defines the title of the CMS search results block. You can use the {{query}} placeholder to display the searched string</li>

               			will display one of the text portions that contains the searched keywords. This parameter defines the maximum snippet length, in number of characters</li>

			<h2 id="directsearch">Defining direct search queries</h2>
					
					<p>The direct search query feature of Kick Butt Search is helpfull in two scenarios:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>You want to define a "I'm feeling lucky" search. When searching for a specific query, you want the user to be taken directly to a product detail/
						category detail/cms page/blog post instead of showing a traditional search results page.</li>
						<li>You want to have total control over the results displayed for a specific query.</li>
					</ul>

                    <p>To define a search term with exact results, go to Catalog->Direct Search Queries in the admin panel.
                        The page will list all the direct searches (empty if this is the first time you are using it).
                        Press the "Add Direct Search Result" button:</p>

                    <p><img src="skin/img/c3.png" /></p>

                    <p>Fill in the fields for the direct search result:</p>

                    <p><img src="skin/img/c6.png" /></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Search Phrase:</strong> the exact search phrase that we want to define search results for</li>
                        <li><strong>Store view:</strong> If you want this to be active only on certain store views, set them here. Leave "All store views"
                        selected to apply it on all your storeviews</li>
                        <li><strong>Status:</strong> enable/disable this direct search query</li>
                    </ul>

					<p>After filling the general details, go to the one or more of the additional tabs (Products, CMS Pages, Blogs, Categories) and pick one or more 
					entities that will be displayed in the search results. For each search result, you can specify a numeric "order" parameter. This will define the order of
					the search results (the lower the number the higher the result). Here is an example on how to pick 2 products and add order numbers:</p>

                    <p><img src="skin/img/c7.png" /></p>

                    <p>You cannot specify zero entities for a search result. If you specify a single entity, the customer will be directly taken to that entitie's detail
                    page. If multiple results are specified, the customer will see a result page with the defined entities.</p>

            <h3>When I try to access your extension's configuration at System->Configuration->[[EXTENSION PATH]], I get a 404 error</h3>
            <p>Logout & Login back into the Magento admin panel.</p>
            
            <h3>I have installed the AW Blogs extension and want to search blog entries, but now I am getting a fatal error when doing a search</h3>
            <p>If you installed the blog extension after Kick Butt Search, do the step described <a href="#blog">here</a></p>
            
            <h3>I cannot see entity X on my search results. What do I do?</h3>
            	<ol>
            		<li>Try re-indexing catalog search (<a href="#reindex-catalog-search">click here to see how to do it</a>)</li>
            		<li>Make sure the entity type is searchable. For example, if you are missing a CMS page result, go to System->Configuration->Kick Butt Search 
            		and make sure "Enable searching through CMS Pages?" is set to "Yes". If it was set to "No", you need to re-index catalog search after enabling. Product
            		search is always enabled</li>
            		<li>Is your specific entity searchable? Go to the entity edit screen (i.e. CMS page edit screen) and make sure the "Is Searchable" property is 
            		set to "Yes"</li>
            		<li>Are you sure there is no direct search result defined for you search? Go to Catalog -> Direct Search Queries and make sure the string you are
            		searching for is not defined as a direct search query which does not include your result</li>
            		<li>On what attribute is the keyword(s) you are searching for defined inside the entity? Have a look at 
            		<a href="#field_meaning">The meaning of title, SKU and content fields for the searchable entities</a>. If the keyword is part of an attribute 
            		that is not present in that table, it will not be searched</li>
            	</ol>

            <h3>I see that you extension searches through blog posts, but I cannot see any option related to blogs, neither can I search through them.</h3>
            <p>Kick Butt Search searches through blog posts created with the AheadWorks Blog module. See <a href="#blog">here</a> on how to install this extension.
            If you have a different blog extension installed, Kick Butt Search will not be able to search through the posts.</p>
            
            <h3><a href="#ft_min_word_len">How to set ft_min_word_len and repair the database.</a></h3>
            <p>To set "ft_min_word_len" someone has to have access to mysql's configuration file "my.cnf". On a linux system with a default configuration it can be found 
                under "/etc/mysql/my.cnf". This file has some sections that have titles written in brackets. To add or change "ft_min_word_len" 
                we have to look under the section "[mysqld]". If it's not already there we can add it on a new line with the value that we want (default value is 4), 
                for example 3 "ft_min_word_len = 3".
                After you set the "ft_min_word_len" you have to restart the mysql server and you can check the new value by running the following query 
                "show variables like 'ft_min_word_len'". After restarting the server, the databases have to be repaired, to do a check on repair on all you can use:
                "mysqlcheck -u root -p --auto-repair -c --all-databases".
                We recommend that you first try this on a development server that has the same mysql instance and databases as the production server, before trying this
                on the production server.
                If you don't have ssh access to the server, please ask your hosting provider to do these changes for you.
